#  AI-Powered Weather Agent (Built with n8n)

An intelligent weather assistant built using **no-code automation** with **n8n**, capable of understanding natural language queries and sending real-time weather updates via **chat and email**.

>  **Watch the demo video in this repository to see it in action!**

##  About the Project

I'm excited to share my latest project â€” an **AI-Powered Weather Agent** built as part of my final year BTech project in **Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**.
This assistant intelligently handles user queries like *"What's the weather in Hyderabad?"*, fetches live data, and sends personalized weather updates directly to your **email inbox**.

##  How It Works

1.  User asks a natural language question â€” e.g., *"What's the weather in Hyderabad?"*
2.  **OpenAI Chat Model** processes and understands the query
3.  **Memory** tracks past interactions (basic context retention)
4.  **Weather API** fetches real-time weather data (temperature, etc.)
5.  **Gmail API** sends the response to the userâ€™s email

## Tech Stack

* [n8n](https://n8n.io/) â€“ No-code workflow automation
* OpenAI API â€“ Natural language understanding
* Weather API â€“ Real-time weather data
* Gmail API â€“ Email integration
* Basic memory â€“ Tracks recent context in conversations

##  Use Case

A smart, lightweight assistant combining **AI + automation** to deliver quick, actionable weather updates via **chat and email** â€” useful for daily planning, alerts, or personalized services.

##  About Me

 Iâ€™m a **4th-year BTech student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science**, passionate about building real-world AI solutions using automation, language models, and APIs.
